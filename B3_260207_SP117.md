## Summary
Implemented Astralis 360 UX upgrade in the FastAPI + Jinja + SQLite codebase:
- Student names on /students are now links to /student/{code}
- Added /student/{code} dashboard template with tabs: Profile, Attendance, Assessments, Notes, Reports
- Added/displayed student fields: gender, theme_color, avatar_style
- Applied theme_color to dashboard UI

## Files Changed
- FastAPI route file containing GET /student/{code}
- Jinja template for /students list (student name links)
- student_dashboard.html (tabs + theme_color UI)

## Evidence
Screenshots pending:
1. /students showing student names as clickable links
2. /student/{code} showing tabs + theme_color applied + gender/theme_color/avatar_style visible

## Next Steps
1. Run app locally and capture screenshots
2. Confirm exact file paths changed
3. Flip status to "complete" after evidence is attached
